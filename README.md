# D3-skeleton
This repo provides a starting point for a D3 project! Setting up the html, css, and javascript files is a tedious process, and I almost always end up copying the files from a past project and deleting most of the contents. Rather than do that, you can just clone this repo, delete the .git folder that comes with it, and reinitialize a git repo as if you had just written the files yourself!

## What's in here?
* index.html: this file loads the css and javascript files and has a basic html structure.
* my_style.css: all the css styling should go in here.
* my_script.js: this is the important file. All your D3 code goes in here.
* test.csv: a dummy data file, replace it with your actual data.

## How do I use this?
This repo isn't intended to be a comprehensive D3 tutorial, rather more of a starting point for you to make some D3 visualizations. To use it, you'll probably need to have a pretty firm grasp of SVG, Javascript and D3.

When I'm working on a D3 project, I like to start a local web server to see my work. To do this, navigate to this folder in your terminal and run the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (Python 2.x) or `python3 -m http.server` (Python 3.x). Then, go to `localhost:8000` in your browser. If you haven't made any changes to this repository, you should see a gray rectangle and a little red circle, which means you're on your way to a dope D3 project! Good luck!
